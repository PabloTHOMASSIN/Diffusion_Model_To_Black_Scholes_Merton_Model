ESILV A3 Project "Application du modèle des équations de la chaleur à la finance, l’équation de Black-Scholes."

## Introduction
Hello everyone,

Welcome to our ESILV A3 project, titled "Application of the Heat Equation Model to Finance: The Black-Scholes Equation." This project explores the intersection of mathematical modeling, finance, and numerical analysis by applying the principles of the heat equation to the renowned Black-Scholes equation.

In this GitHub repository, we have curated all the essential elements of our project, including code implementations, documentation, and relevant resources. Our main objective is to showcase how mathematical concepts, such as the heat equation, can be adapted and applied to financial models like the Black-Scholes equation to better understand and predict market behavior.

Through this project, we aim to provide insights into the dynamics of financial markets and the theoretical underpinnings of option pricing. We also seek to demonstrate the practical implementation of mathematical models in real-world financial scenarios.

We invite you to explore our GitHub repository and share your thoughts, feedback, or questions. Your engagement is crucial in fostering discussion and advancing our understanding of mathematical finance.

Thank you for joining us on this journey of exploring the application of the heat equation model to finance through the lens of the Black-Scholes equation!

Best regards,
